## Features

The features of Tlumach include:

* Integration with XAML (in WPF, WinUI, MAUI, and Avalonia projects) via bindings to provide localized UI. The markup extension is provided for easy integration.
* Use via the translation manager or by accessing generated translation units, which enable syntax checking in design time.
* The Generator class to generate source code with translation units for static use and for XAML UIs during compilation of the project.
* Suitable for server and web applications thanks to the possibility to obtain translations for different languages/locales concurrently, even within one thread.
* Support for on-the-fly switching of current language/locale with automatic update of the UI (for XAML UIs).
* Automatic fallback to the basic locale (e.g., "de-AT" -> "de-DE") translation or to the default translation if a translation for a particular key is not available in the locale-specific translation.
* Handling of translation files in JSON, Arb (JSON with additional features, used in Dart/Flutter), simple INI, TOML, CSV and TSV, and .NET ResX files.
* Loading of translations from assembly resources, from disk files, or from a custom source (via events).
* Smart search for localized files using ISO 639-1 names (e.g., "de" or "hr") and using RFC 5646 locale identifiers (e.g., "de-AT", "pt-BR"). It is also possible to specify custom names for files with translations via a configuration file or to provide translation files via events, making it possible to fetch the translations from the network.
* Support for multiple translation sets in one project. For example, you can keep server log strings in one file and client messages in another.
* Each translation set can have a hierarchy of groups of translation entries, enabling easy management of translations (depending on the source format).
* Automatic recognition and support for templated strings in Arb and .NET formats. This includes support for .NET- and Arb-style placeholders and support of main ICU features ("number", "select", and "plural" types) in Arb-style placeholders. (Note: placeholder style is independent of the file format, i.e., you can use Arb-style placeholders in a ResX or TOML translation file.)
* The possibility to control the found translation entries or provide entries for missing keys via events (it may be necessary if an application should use some phrases configured by a user rather than from translations).
